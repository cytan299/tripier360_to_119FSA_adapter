# An adapter for coupling an Astro-Physics AP1100GTO or AP900 to an  iOptron Tri-Pier 360

I wanted to mount my AP1100GTO to an iOptron Tri-pier 360. In order to
do this, I had to make a coupling adapter that sat between the AP
flat surface adapter (119FSA) and the iOptron tri-pier. The photograph
of the adapter is shown below:

The adapter with the 119FSA bolted onto it and attached to the tripier
is shown below:

As you can see, I made the adapter to accept a compass so that the tripier can be
oriented to point towards Polaris.
